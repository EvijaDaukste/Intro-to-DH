<p><quote>Who are you?</quote> said <character>the Caterpillar</character>.</p>
<p>This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. <character>Alice</character>
replied, rather shyly, <quote>I—I hardly know, Sir, just at present—at
least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must
have been changed several times since then.</quote></p>
<p><quote>What do you mean by that?</quote> said <character>the Caterpillar</character>,
sternly. <quote><pun><hi rendition="simple:bold">Explain
yourself!</hi></pun> <note type="editorial">

 </quote></p>
<p><quote>I can’t <pun><hi rendition="simple:bold">explain myself</hi></pun>, I’m
afraid, Sir,</quote> said <character>Alice</character>, <quote>because I’m not myself, you
see.</quote></p>
<p><quote>I don’t see,</quote> said <character>the Caterpillar</character>.</p>
<p><quote>I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,</quote> <character>Alice</character> replied,
very politely, <quote>for I can’t understand it myself, to begin with;
and being so many different sizes in a day is very
confusing.</quote></p>
<p><quote>It isn’t,</quote> said <character>the Caterpillar</character>.</p>
<p><quote>Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,</quote> said <character>Alice</character>;
<quote>but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you
know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it
a little queer, won’t you?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Not a bit,</quote> said <character>the Caterpillar</character>.</p>
<p><quote>Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,</quote> said
<character>Alice</character>: <quote>all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.</quote></p>
<p><quote>You!</quote> said <character>the Caterpillar</character> contemptuously. <quote>Who
are you?</quote></p>
<p>Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
<character>Alice</character> felt a little irritated at <character>the Caterpillar’s</character> making such very
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, <quote>I
think you ought to tell me who you are, first.</quote></p>
