<p><quote>You are not attending!</quote> said the Mouse to Alice,
severely. <quote>What are you thinking of?</quote></p>

<p><quote>I beg your pardon,</quote> said Alice very humbly: <quote>you
had got to the fifth bend, I think?</quote></p>

<p><quote>I <hi rendition="simple:bold">had not</hi>!</quote> cried the
Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p>

<p></quote> said Alice,
always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.
<quote>Oh, do let me help to undo it!</quote></p>

<p><quote>I shall do nothing of the sort,</quote> said the Mouse,
getting up and walking away. <quote>You insult me by talking such
nonsense!</quote></p>

<p><quote>I didn’t mean it!</quote> pleaded poor Alice. <quote>But
you’re so easily offended, you know!</quote></p>

<p>The Mouse only growled in reply.</p>

<p><quote>Please come back, and finish your story!</quote> Alice called
after it. And the others all joined in chorus <quote>Yes, please
do!</quote> But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a
little quicker.</p>

<p><quote>What a pity it wouldn’t stay!</quote> sighed the Lory, as soon
as it was quite out of sight. And an <hi rendition="simple:bold">old
Crab</hi> <note type="editorial">
<list type="ordered:arabic">

<p>took the opportunity of saying to her daughter <quote>Ah, my
dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!</quote>
<quote>Hold your tongue, Ma!</quote> said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. <quote>You’re enough to try the patience of
<hi rendition="simple:bold">an oyster</hi>!</quote></p>

<p><quote>I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!</quote> said Alice
aloud, addressing nobody in particular. <quote> She’d soon fetch it
back!</quote></p>
