Lewis Carroll
# Alice's Adventures in Wonderland


![Book Cover Alice in Wonderland](/Cover_Alice_in_Wonderland.jpg)


This blog was created or the purpose of exploring the possibilities and tools learned in study course Introduction in Digital Humanities.

It has been 5 years since I bought the Puffin Penguins 2014 edition of
Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" in a thrift shop for 50 cents. The book has traveled around with not only with me, but also with some of my university colleagues as well. And from the 50 cents its value has grown
unmeasurable because of all the research notes and comments in it.

Since my university colleagues and I did not have the necessary tools to do the
tagging and noting digitally, all the notes are handwritten in the text and
added with sticky notes on the page margins.

These notes are about puns in the text of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and in this blog I will try to digitize these notes with the help of the tools I have learned in the Introduction in Digital Humanities class.
