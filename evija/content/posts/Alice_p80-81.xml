<p><quote>Treacle,</quote> said <character>the Dormouse</character>, without considering at
all, this time.</p>
<p><quote>I want a clean cup,</quote> interrupted <character>the Hatter</character>:
<quote>let’s all move one place on.</quote></p>
<p>He moved on as he spoke, and <character>the Dormouse</character> followed him: <character>the March
Hare</character> moved into <character>the Dormouse’s</character> place, and <character>Alice</character> rather unwillingly took
the place of <character>the March Hare</character>. <character>The Hatter</character> was the only one who got any
advantage from the change; and <character>Alice</character> was a good deal worse off than
before, as <character>the March Hare</character> had just upset the milk-jug into his
plate.</p>
<p><character>Alice</character> did not wish to offend <character>the Dormouse</character> again, so she began very
cautiously: <quote>But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the
treacle from?</quote></p>
<p><quote>You can draw water out of a water-well,</quote> said <character>the
Hatter</character>; <quote>so I should think you could draw treacle out of a
treacle-well—eh, stupid?</quote></p>
<p><quote>But they were <pun><hi rendition="simple:bold">in the

,</quote> <character>Alice</character> said to <character>the Dormouse</character>, not choosing to notice
this last remark.</p>
<p><quote>Of course they were,</quote> said <character>the Dormouse</character>:
<quote><pun><hi rendition="simple:bold">well in.</hi></pun></quote></p>
<p>This answer so confused poor <character>Alice</character>, that she let <character>the Dormouse</character> go on
for some time without interrupting it.</p>
<p><quote>They were learning to draw,</quote> <character>the Dormouse</character> went on,
yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; <quote>and
they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an
M——</quote></p>
<p><quote>Why with an M?</quote> said <character>Alice</character>.</p>
<p><quote>Why not?</quote> said the March Hare.</p>
<p><character>Alice</character> was silent.</p>
<p><character>The Dormouse<character> had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by <character>the Hatter<character>, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: <quote>——that begins with an M, such as
mousetraps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
things are <quote>much of a muchness</quote> 13—did you ever see such a
thing as a drawing of a muchness!</quote></p>
<p><quote>Really, now you ask me,</quote> said <character>Alice</character>, very much
confused, <quote>I don’t think——</quote></p>
<p><quote>Then you shouldn’t talk,</quote> said <character>the Hatter</character>.</p>
<p>This piece of rudeness was more than <character>Alice</character> could bear:</p>
