# Work in progress notes

1.
edauk@DESKTOP-KA3PNT6 MINGW64 /c/Hugo/evija/content/posts (master)
$ pandoc Alice_p29.md -o Alice_p29.xml --to=tei

Didn't render to TEI file. opened simple xml file and i had to write all TEI header manually.



2.
in markdown file the note tag did not work, however it was rendered in the xml file as a footnote anyway.


3.
In visual Studio code and Atom it was not possible to add the
footnote tag, but in Dillinger tagging worked.

4.
Most of the times something didn't work as supposed to in Git Bash, it was because of a typo or incorrect code

5. While tagging the TEI documents, I decided to tag also all the mentioned characters with the tag <character>.
And use a special tag for all the puns <pun>.
